# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Project: Daily Journal + Mood Tracker
Tech Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind CSS

## Overall Objective

Generate clean, scalable, readable code that supports a Daily Journal + Mood Tracker application. Follow modern React and TypeScript best practices and prioritize maintainability.

---

## Core Coding Principles

1. Use functional components only with React Hooks.
2. Use React Context API + custom hooks for application state (journal entries, mood data, user session).
3. Store Supabase calls inside /src/services/ and avoid calling Supabase directly from components.
4. All files must use TypeScript (.tsx, .ts).
5. Follow strict ESLint + Prettier standards.
6. Maintain feature balance between journal and mood tracking.

---

## Folder Structure Style

Use this structure and add new files in matching locations:

```
src/
  components/
  pages/
  hooks/
  services/
  utils/
  styles/
```

Notes:

- Keep shared UI components in /src/components.
- Keep route level pages in /src/pages.
- Keep context providers and shared state hooks in /src/hooks.
- Keep all Supabase interaction in /src/services.

---

## Tailwind CSS Rules

- Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling solution.
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS.
- Keep custom CSS minimal and limited to:
  - small global base rules in src/styles/globals.css (optional)
  - third party overrides only when unavoidable

- Do not create per-component CSS files.
- Do not use inline style objects unless you must set a dynamic value that Tailwind cannot express.

### Class style guidance

- Prefer readable class groupings:
  - layout: flex, grid, gap, spacing
  - typography: text sizes, weights, tracking
  - color and borders
  - interaction: hover, focus-visible, active
  - responsive: sm:, md:, lg:

- Always include accessible focus styles (focus-visible:ring or equivalent).
- Use semantic sizing and spacing (avoid overly tight values).
- Keep the UI clean and modern. No animation heavy styles by default.

### Tailwind config expectations

When scaffolding, ensure the project includes:

- tailwind.config.ts or tailwind.config.js with correct content paths
- postcss.config.js
- Tailwind directives in the global stylesheet:
  - @tailwind base;
  - @tailwind components;
  - @tailwind utilities;

---

## Naming Conventions

Use:

- camelCase for variables, functions, files
- PascalCase for components and hooks
- Clear and descriptive names
- Example: JournalEntryForm.tsx, useJournalContext.ts

---

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Produce balanced styling: clean layout, responsive spacing, accessible color contrast.
- Focus on readability and a calm journaling experience.
- Prefer semantic HTML: main, header, section, article.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness (sm, md, lg breakpoints).
- Do not generate overly complex animations.

---

## Comments & Documentation

- Every component and custom hook should include TSDoc style documentation explaining props, logic, and return values.
- Add inline comments to clarify complex logic.
- Avoid obvious comments.

---

## Data + Supabase Logic

- Never place Supabase logic inside components.
- All queries live inside /src/services.
- Services must:
  - return typed responses
  - throw typed errors on failure

- Keep async functions predictable and consistent.

Example structure:

```
src/services/
  journalService.ts
  moodService.ts
  authService.ts
```

---

## Component Rules

- Prefer composition over prop drilling.
- Break large pages into smaller UI components.
- Use custom hooks for shared logic (useJournal, useMood, useAuth).
- Keep components strongly typed and reusable.
- Keep presentational components free of business logic when possible.

---

## State Management

Use:

- Context Provider pattern
- Custom hooks
- Minimal local state inside components

Example:

```
src/hooks/
  useJournalContext.ts
  useMoodContext.ts
  useAuthContext.ts
```

---

## Testing Guidance

- Prefer React Testing Library for component tests.
- Prioritize logic tests for services and hooks.
- Place tests in **tests** folders or alongside files based on repository convention.
- Mock Supabase client calls in service tests.

---

## Performance Expectations

- Avoid unnecessary network calls.
- Memoize expensive computations when needed.
- Keep rerenders minimal (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo only when justified).
- Prefer pagination or lazy loading for long journal lists.

---

## Output Format Expectations

When generating code, Copilot should:

1. Suggest complete solutions.
2. Use current project architecture.
3. Maintain strict typing.
4. Avoid creating unused helpers or blank files.
5. Use Tailwind classes consistently for styling.

---

## Prioritization Guidance

For all future suggestions:

- Treat journal entry storage and mood tracking as equally important parts of the product.
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- Value readability over brevity.

---

## Do Not

- Do not use class components.
- Do not generate inline Supabase code in UI files.
- Do not override folder structure.
- Do not create per-component CSS files.
- Do not generate animation heavy UI.
- Do not break naming standards.

---

## Goal

Help build a clean, scalable, production ready Daily Journal + Mood Tracker built with Vite, React, Supabase, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with maintainable code, predictable structure, and smooth developer experience.
